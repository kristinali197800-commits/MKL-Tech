    <h1>About MKL Tech</h1>
    <p>Started in Cherry Hill, NJ — built for people who just want their computers to work.</p>

      <p>
        MKL Tech started because we noticed a clear gap in our community:
        people were overpaying for computers that didn’t match their needs.
        Big-box stores pushed unnecessary parts, online guides were confusing,
        and trustworthy alternatives were hard to find.
      </p>
      <p>
        We began by helping classmates and local families build and repair PCs that fit real workloads
        and budgets. Over time, that work grew into MKL Tech, a small, focused PC service built on
        transparent pricing, clear explanations, and reliable performance.
