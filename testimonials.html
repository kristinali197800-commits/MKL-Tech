        “I brought a $1800 high performance PC for my daughter from this seller for the holidays. Honestly, my purchase went exactly as advertised. The seller is very earnest, nice, and straightforward. He even provided me with warranty so I could rest at ease.
        I don’t usually leave reviews but my daughter absolutely loves her PC and she plays Roblox and Minecraft on it. I looked up the parts and the PC was honestly a steal despite the hefty price tag — seller even included a free keyboard and mouse. Everything went absolutely great, no complaints from my end, only praises. Would definitely go to for every computer.”
